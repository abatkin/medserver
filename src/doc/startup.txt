When the server starts up, it can accept a number of command line options. It
combines these command line options with any (optional) options specified in
the config file, then connects to the database and combines those options with
any options stored in mongo. Options specified earlier (command line, config
file, mongo) are used.

As soon as the server knows what port it can listen on, it starts listening,
which will enable any clients to get an idea of the system status. For example,
if the server can't connect to mongo, a message can be returned to the client
indicating this.
